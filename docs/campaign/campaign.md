# Acc Campaign

!!! warning

This campaign is very hard, and most people won't make it past Mercenary. If you do not know the basics of accuracy, we generally recommend to either play the [115 Progression Campaign](https://discord.gg/j8m8cxr) or use [Rocker's Acc/Low Midspeed playlist.](https://canary.discord.com/channels/762899616986955787/762911163004223498) Current version is 1.14 and can be found in the Acc Champ Discord.

!!! note

This campaign has not been released for Quest, given the CustomCampaigns mod has not been ported yet. We do not know when this will be ported, nor released.
