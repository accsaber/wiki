## The absolute basics

The scoring system for Beat Saber is on a 115 point scale that is distributed as follows:

- 70 points for pre-swing (at least 100 degrees for full points)
- 30 points for post-swing (at least 60 degrees for full points)
- 15 points for accuracy (How close you are to the geometrical center of the note)

As the name of the website implies, we focus on the _accuracy_ part of the game.
