# Mods and settings

## Configs and height

For player height and configs in accuracy maps, typically you want to increase your height slightly. This is because most blocks in acc maps are either in the bottom or middle rows, making it best to increase your height to hit blocks in those lanes with higher accuracy, though, make sure to play around with it a little to find the right settings for you.

## HitScoreVizualizer

If you arenâ€™t using a hit score visualizer, please download one. They are extremely useful in recognizing which patterns you need help working on and also noticing any habits you may have regarding under-swinging.
