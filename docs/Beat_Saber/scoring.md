# Scoring

## Basics

Beat Saber's scoring system has 3 components: _pre-swing_ (the angle between the beginning of a swing and hitting the block), _post-swing_ (the angle for which a swing continues after hitting the block) and _accuracy_ (how close a swing passes to the centre of the block)

In an acc map context, preswing and postswing are generally ignored as they're trivial to achieve max points on, due to the slow speed of the maps.

As our name implies, ACC primarily focuses on the _accuracy_ portion of the score.
