With a low time dependence swing aimed at the centre of the block, your swing could be a bit early/late and you can still get the 115. The lower the time dependence, the larger the timing windows. You may have seen some people have HitScoreVisualizer configs with small numbers under where the points are shown. These numbers are values from 0-100 showing how much their acc relies on timing, so what does that mean? Consider a note in one of the 12 positions and an infinite series of notes behind it. Now imagine a line through the centre of every note like this: If you wanted to get 115 on as many blocks as you could reach, then you\u2019d have to cut down that line. This is what we call a time-independent swing (a value of 0 on the HSV). As a block comes towards you, its centre will move along that line, but since you\u2019re cutting through the whole line, you\u2019ll get 115 regardless of where the block is. In other words, you get 115 regardless of timing. A practical application of this is dot spam. Imagine the same line of notes, but they\u2019re all dots. If you aim for the first note and hit them \u201cnormally\u201d you\u2019ll hit many notes with one swing, and you\u2019ll only be able to cut through the centre of the first. So you\u2019ll get bad accuracy on any of the other notes. If you were to instead swing through the line of centres as mentioned above, you would be able to 115 every note if your aim was good enough. If you were to swing entirely perpendicular to the line of centres, then your swing would be entirely time-dependent (a value of 100 on the HSV). This means that your accuracy is heavily dependent on your timing and not only that, but the time window to hit the block at all is much smaller. This can be seen to some extent when \u201cpizzaing\u201d (where you aim your sabers towards each other), you don\u2019t need to aim to hit notes, but it requires more accurate timing than if you were to swing normally. When not used to cheese but to acc, I like to refer to this as windshield wiping. This technique requires a lot of timing, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it personally, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily bad. Players like Taichi and KingRazer are two players that both use a windshield wiping technique to acc. Generally, this would mean that they\u2019d struggle at higher NJS since the timing windows are much smaller for high acc. But interesting enough, I don\u2019t see either of them struggling with it. Another result of this which many have already realised (especially in true acc), is that it\u2019s easier to move to an outer lane note and swing as if it was the middle lane. It\u2019s clear why this is easier, you can now swing straight down, and it will be a time-independent swing without any extra angling required. This also explains why accing outer lane, is generally much harder than the middle lanes. As you would expect, this works the same but rotated for horizontal notes. With normal swings, horizontal notes in the middle row are much easier to acc than in the top or bottom rows. And as with moving over to the outer lane for outer lane down notes, you can crouch and put the hilt in line with the bottom row to make bottom row horizontal timing easier. If we draw the line of centres for all the different note positions it will look something like this: The middle two notes were omitted because they would block the others, but the same applies to them. Be aware though that this is drawn from the middle of the grid, your own perspective in-game will be different. To take advantage of this information, you\u2019ll need to get a feel for where these lines are for your perspective. It ultimately just comes down to practice to get the hang of it in-game. Something else to be aware of is that the note\u2019s direction and colour have no impact on the lines. As a result, there will be many note placements that simply cannot be hit time independently without moving your hands (and potentially yourself) too far to be viable. HSV measures the time-dependence by taking the z component of the normal to the cut plane. You don\u2019t need to understand what that means or why that works to take advantage of it, but for those that are interested, here\u2019s a proof of it (credit to PulseLane for writing this): Converted from the original Google Doc by Duh Hello","title":"Time Dependence"},{"location":"Beat_Saber/TD/#time-dependence","text":"Time dependence is essentially how much accing a note relies on timing.

None of this is useful if you have no clue what you are doing. What is an \"acc map\" exactly? An acc map is any map where the player does not have to worry about missing notes or under-swinging frequently. Therefore, acc maps focus on the 15 points for accuracy out of the 115. Speed acc, or accuracy on speed maps, is a different skill that the acc community does not focus as much on. There are 3 categories of accuracy maps that we focus on: True : True acc maps are the slowest acc maps and contain simple patterns. They test the player\u2019s precision, with the best true acc players being able to set scores above 99.5%. Standard : Standard acc maps contain common patterns, yet they likely will have denser note concentrations than in true acc maps, giving less time for the player to react and plan out their swings. Tech : Tech acc maps may be faster than true or standard maps, but do not have to be faster, and contain more complex patterns than you would find in those maps; however, maintaining a full combo in tech acc maps is still not too challenging. Strategies you should learn to use while playing accuracy Full Swinging : As stated in the basics page, full swinging means you swing with the full 110/90 swing radius. Achieving this isn't hard, but can take a little bit of focus. We generally recommend gradually increasing the swing angle as you learn. Hilting : A common technique for true and standard acc maps that is easy to implement and greatly improves your accuracy potential is \u201chilting\u201d, or hitting the block with the hilt of your saber. This technique is most commonly used true acc maps and somewhat on standard acc maps. It's more common to hit the notes more with the middle of your saber on tech acc. Time Dependent Swings : As you play accuracy maps, you may notice the angle you can cut the notes at is quite lenient. The notes allow you to cut them as much as 60 degrees in each direction away from the cut direction. Using this to your advantage is called cutting with low time dependence. Need a quick video guide? Check out this video by Dedzix on the topic, or read the TD page we have. Relaxed swings : Having relaxed swings while playing accuracy is almost a requirement. One reason for this is, if you can control your swings, you usually have a lot better accuracy. One main factor for people having worse acc is a phenomenon called \"saber wobble,\" which only appears when you swing fast enough to where you can't reliably control your swings - Pay attention to a figure-8 or an oval swing pattern, this is an indication that you don't have proper control of your swings. Swing speed : Pay attention to the speed of your swings. If they are too quick your swings will end up being snappy, if they are too slow, you'll end up missing as a result. Play around with it and find your perfect middleground between speed and accuracy.","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"Beat_Saber/How_to_improve/definitions/#definitions","text":"Warning Make sure you have atleast a basic understanding of accuracy before you read this.

The campaign is initially divided into three paths, true, standard, and tech acc. You'll need to clear one path all the way to one of the ACC Champ milestones and pass it to join the clan. It's important to note that this campaign is not intended to be an introduction to acc, it starts hard and rapidly gets harder. At the time of writing, the final milestone and several of the levels preceding it aren't passable by anyone. All of the levels are simply acc requirements, there's none of the frustrating \"maintain acc\" challenges you might be familiar with from the 115 guild progression campaign. Note This campaign has not been released for Quest, given the CustomCampaigns mod has not been ported yet. We do not know when this will be ported, nor released. Warning This campaign is very hard, and most people won't make it past Mercenary. If you do not know the basics of accuracy, we generally recommend to either play the 115 Progression Campaign or use Rocker's Acc/Low Midspeed playlist. Current version is 1.15 and can be found in the Acc Champ Discord. How To Play We have a github repo with campaign zips that contains everything you need to play the campaign, just put it in your Beat Saber folder and extract it, that's all.
